# Smart-Agriculture-System-using-IoT
<br/> Skills Required:
<br/> IOT Application Development,IOT Cloud Platform

Project Description:
<br/>
<p>Smart Agriculture System based on IoT can monitor soil moisture and climatic conditions to grow and yield a good crop.
<br/>The farmer can also get the realtime weather forecasting data by using external platforms like Open Weather API.
<br/>Farmer is provided a mobile app using which he can monitor the temperature,humidity and soil moisture parameters along with weather forecasting details.
<br/>Based on all the parameters he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application.
<br/>Even if the farmer is not present near his crop he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application from anywhere.
<br/>Here we are using the Online IoT simulator for getting the Temperature,Humidity and Soil Moisture values.
